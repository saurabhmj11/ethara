## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4 + Recharts
- **Backend:** FastAPI 0.115 + SQLAlchemy 2 + Pydantic v2 + Uvicorn
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (local dev) — switchable via `DATABASE_URL`
- **AI Assistant:** Hybrid — rule-based intent detection + template-based natural-language generation (always works) + optional LLM refinement via `z-ai` CLI (best-effort)
- **Seed data:** Faker
- **Deployment targets:** Vercel (frontend), Render/Railway (backend), any Postgres host

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ and `pip`
- Node.js 18+ and `npm`

### Option A: One-step launcher

```bash
bash start.sh
```

Starts both servers in the background:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- Swagger: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Option B: Manual setup

**1. Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env            # edit if using PostgreSQL

python -m scripts.seed_db --reset    # seed 5,000 employees (~30s)
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

**2. Frontend (in a new terminal):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend uses **relative URLs** (`/api/v1/...`) which are proxied to the
backend via `next.config.ts` rewrites. This avoids CORS issues and works in
preview environments where the backend port isn't directly exposed to the
browser. The proxy destination is controlled by the `BACKEND_URL` env var
(defaults to `http://localhost:8000`).

## 🗄️ Database Schema

See [`docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`](docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md) for the full schema with ER diagram.

**Entities:** `projects`, `floors`, `bays`, `seats`, `employees`, `activity_logs`

**Key relationships:**
- `Employee.project_id → Project.id` (many-to-one)
- `Employee.seat_id → Seat.id` (one-to-one, unique)
- `Seat.bay_id → Bay.id` (many-to-one)
- `Bay.floor_id → Floor.id` (many-to-one)
- `Seat.reserved_for_employee_id → Employee.id` (for new-joiner reservations)

| GET | `/dashboard/project-distribution` | Top projects by employee count |
| GET | `/dashboard/department-distribution` | Headcount by department |
| GET | `/dashboard/activity-logs` | Audit trail |
| GET | `/employees` | List/search/filter employees (paginated) |
| POST | `/employees` | Create employee |
| GET | `/employees/{id}` | Get employee |
| PUT | `/employees/{id}` | Update employee |

## 🤖 AI Assistant

The AI Assistant uses a **hybrid architecture** that always produces a natural-language answer:

1. **Rule-based intent detection** — regex patterns classify the query into one of 9 intents (available_seats, occupied_seats, new_joiners, floor_utilization, project_employees, employee_seat, project_distribution, department_distribution, total_stats).
2. **Data fetching** — based on the intent, the appropriate SQLAlchemy query runs against the DB and returns structured data.
3. **Template-based natural-language generation** — a deterministic per-intent template generates a polished natural-language answer from the structured data. **This always works**, regardless of environment.
4. **Optional LLM refinement** (best-effort) — if the `z-ai` CLI is available (sandbox/dev only), the template answer is refined by the LLM. On any failure (CLI missing, timeout, parse error), the template answer is used as-is.

This means the AI Assistant satisfies the "Natural Language Query Interface" requirement in every deployment environment — production without the LLM still gets real natural-language answers, not raw JSON.

**Sample queries:**
- "How many available seats are there on Floor 2?"
- "Show me all new joiners without a seat"
- "What is the floor-wise utilization?"
- "How many employees are in project Atlas?"
- "Where does employee ETH0001 sit?"
- "Give me an overall summary"

## 📊 Seed Data

The seed script generates a realistic dataset:

| Entity | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Floors | 4 |
| Bays | 32 (8 per floor) |
| Seats | 832 (26 per bay) |
| Projects | 60 |
| Employees | 5,000 |
| - Active | 4,750 |
| - New joiners (ONBOARDING) | 250 |
| - With seat | ~625 (75% seat utilization) |
| - Without seat (active) | ~4,125 (remote/hot-desk) |
| Activity logs | 50 sample entries |

To re-seed: `python -m scripts.seed_db --reset`
For a smaller dataset (1,000 employees): `python -m scripts.seed_db --reset --small`

## 🚢 Deployment

See [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for full deployment instructions.

### ✅ Live Deployment URLs

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| 🖥️ Frontend (Netlify) | https://etharasl.netlify.app |
| ⚙️ Backend API (Render) | https://ethara-backend-6ens.onrender.com |
| 📖 Swagger / API Docs | https://ethara-backend-6ens.onrender.com/docs |
| 🗄️ Database | PostgreSQL on Render (Free tier) |

### Backend → Render (uses `render.yaml`)

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Go to https://render.com/deploy and connect your repo (or click "New Blueprint" and select the repo).
3. Render reads `render.yaml` and auto-provisions:
   - A PostgreSQL database (`ethara-db`)
   - A Python web service (`ethara-backend`)
4. `DATABASE_URL` is injected automatically via the blueprint — no manual steps needed.
5. To seed the database, call the seed endpoint via Swagger:
   `POST https://ethara-backend-6ens.onrender.com/api/seed-database`

### Frontend → Netlify

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Go to https://app.netlify.com and import your GitHub repo.
3. Netlify reads `netlify.toml` at the repo root — no manual settings needed.
4. Add env var in Netlify Dashboard: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = `https://ethara-backend-6ens.onrender.com`
5. Deploy. Netlify builds a static Next.js export and serves it globally.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the backend smoke tests:

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/test_endpoints.py
```

This hits every endpoint with sample requests and verifies responses. All 24 endpoints return 200/201/204 in the latest run.
